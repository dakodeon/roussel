An electronic version of Raymond Roussel's "Nouvelles impressions d'Afrique", done in HTML with a little jQuery. Anshul Amar helped me with the initial JavaScript for this. This can be viewed online at http://withhiddennoise.net/roussel/

Still needs:
* Color the parentheses
* A few cases where parentheses aren't lining up correctly
* Arrow controls for navigation
