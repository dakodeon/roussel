An electronic version of Raymond Roussel's "Nouvelles impressions d'Afrique", done in HTML with a little jQuery. Anshul Amar helped me with the initial JavaScript for this. This can be viewed online at http://withhiddennoise.net/roussel/

(Make a version of this where different levels of parentheses have different colors, as Roussel initially intended.)
